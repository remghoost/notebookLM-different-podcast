This is an example I was working on last night attempting to make a single narrator.

It *sort of* works. Not entirely though. Still working on this one.

The reason I'm chosing the woman over the man is that their inflection works better storytelling. The male narrator also prefers to "explain" things most of the time, which doesn't work that well for storytelling.
